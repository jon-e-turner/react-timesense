Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project, but unfortunately I don't expect there to be much to do until the app is closer to mvp. If you still want to contribute, please 

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the repository,
- Make your changes, and
- Open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

I will review it and either accept it or suggest changes.
