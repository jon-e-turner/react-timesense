## Reporting a Vulnerability

I have enabled [private vunlerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) and prefer that course.

Alternatively, open an issue and I'll be notified.
